Readme.md

Hey to whoever decided to read this. I am Mr. Milk.
I, as of Summer 2023, am a newbie coder taking up HTML5, And CSS. Python seems doable as well, but JavaScript seems comlicated ☹️. 

I liek raspberry pi, and most forms of linux.


 **NO ARCH. I NO LIEK ARCH. AM ToO INEXPERIENCED.**

 
I like experimenting on a Raspberry Pi 5 I pre-ordered a long time ago, and came in december. 
'Tis Fun.

I am going to make a list of useful commands I have collected in my 2 years of working on a pi 4, and now a pi 5.
Seeya!
