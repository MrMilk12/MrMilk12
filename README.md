Readme.md

Hey to whoever decided to read this. I am Mr. Milk.
I, as of Summer 2023, am a newbie coder taking up HTML5, And CSS. Python seems doable as well, but JavaScript seems comlicated ☹️

  If you've found this profile, than thank you. I spent A long time trying to manage web development projects, but using github has made it easier.
  I am designing HTML5, and if you have any thoughts or criticizms you would like to share, feel free to contact me through a repo's issues site.

  Bye, whoever read this!
